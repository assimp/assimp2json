### Introduction ###

`assimp2json` is a command line tool designed to expose the import capabilities of `assimp`, the [Open Asset Import Library](http://assimp.sourceforge.net) to WebGl developers. The tool takes a single 3d model as input file, imports it using `assimp` and converts the result to `json`.

`assimp2json` is platform-independent, its only dependency is `assimp` itself.

### Output Format ###

The output format is a one-by-one translation of [Assimp's C datastructure](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/structai_scene.html) , with a few changes to make the resulting `json` look more natural. All fields are lower-case and the prefixes (such as m, pc, ..) are omitted. Array lengths are not written as this information is implicitly given. Empty arrays are not written at all, i.e. a node without children doesn't have an empty `children:[]` field.

The `/samples` folder contains some sample `json` files.

### Build ###

The build system for assimp2json is CMake. To build, use either the CMake GUI or the CMake command line utility. __Note__: make sure you pulled the `assimp` submodule, i.e. with `git submodule init && git submodule update`

### Usage ###

``` 
$ assimp2json [flags] input_file [output_file] 
```

(omit the `output_file` argument to get the `json` string on stdout)

Invoke `assimp2json` with no arguments for detailed information.
